# Project Structure and Best Practices

## Current Structure Analysis
The project is properly organized following best practices with a clear separation of concerns:
```
backend/           # Main application code
└── app/          # Core application components
    ├── api/           # API route handlers
    ├── core/          # Core configuration with pydantic settings
    ├── models/        # Database models
    ├── schemas/       # Pydantic models
    └── services/      # Business logic
infra/            # Infrastructure as Code (Pulumi)
```
